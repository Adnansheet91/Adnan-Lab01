# Adnan-Lab01
**Name:** Adnan Sheet

**URL:** https://adnan-lab01.herokuapp.com/

**Name of the Endpoint:** https://adnan-lab01.herokuapp.com/adnan

First, I deployed a node app following the Heroku getting-started-with-nodejs. I could successfully deploy to the cloud. Then I create a basic app using node. The app has two routes: landing page and name endpoint. I set the named endpoint as ***/adnan***
Then I push the code on GitHub and try to connect Heroku with GitHub. But I face an internal server error. Later, I learned that Heroku temporarily closed GitHub and Heroku direct integration due to security issues. Then I follow Heroku instructions, push the code to Heroku, and deploy my webapp. I also edit my code and deploy it again to check if the change is working correctly or not.
